// In ES6 you have standard objects, but you also have Maps and Sets.

// Maps are like objects, but the keys can be any data type, not just strings or symbols. Also, Maps keep their keys in the order in which they were added, so iterating over a map with a for...of loop returns keys in order.

//Sets are like arrays. They only store keys, no values. And these keys are unique. Sets can't contain duplicate keys.

const a = new Map();

const b = new Set();

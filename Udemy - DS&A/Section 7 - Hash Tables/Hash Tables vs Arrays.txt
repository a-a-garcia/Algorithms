Hash Tables are good when you want quick access to certain values. 

Hash Tables are placed all over the place in memory, whereas Arrays are stored next to each other in memory.

Objects have O(1) for search, insert (collision can occur, but it's not particularly common), lookup, delete.

Arrays have O(n) for search, insert, delete.

Arrays, great for ordered collections, objects are great for its key value pairs.

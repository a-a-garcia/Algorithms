Recursion isnt technically an algo. It's more a way of thinking.

One of the most popular interview topics.

When you're searching for files on your computer, you can't do it just by looking at one folder. You need to look at your files recursively.

you can ls -R in your terminal and it will list the contents of all the folders.

-R stands for 'recursively'

Recursion is a function that refers to itself inside of the function.

function inception() {
    inception();
}

when this run it's going to call itself.

it's great for tasks that have repeated subtasks to do.

DOM traversal, nested objects, are examples of recursion.

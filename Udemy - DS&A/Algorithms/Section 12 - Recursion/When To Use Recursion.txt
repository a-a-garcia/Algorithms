When should we use recursion?

When it gets to complicated problems like traversing or searching through trees or graphs, recursion is really useful and better than iterative. With sorting, recursion is also preferred.

In summary,

Every time you are using a tree, or converting something into a tree, consider recursion.

    These 3 things in a interview question can trigger a recursive solution 

    1. A problem can be divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
    2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature.
    3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.

Divide and conquer using recursion.

Anything you can do with recursion, CAN be done with a loop.

So why would we ever want to use recursion? Especially if recursion sometimes results in exponential time?

- For some problems, it's easier to write

:)
+ DRY
+ Readable

:(
- Large Stack 
- Iterative solutions tend to be more efficient because they don't make these additional function calls.

There's always two options, pros and cons.

One rule you can follow is that use recursion when you are working with data structures whose depth you don't know. (tree data structures)

Tail Code Optimization -
allows recursions to be called without increasing the call stack.
there are ways to write recursion to be more efficient

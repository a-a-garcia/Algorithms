What's all the fuss with sorting?

sort() is built into a lot of languages.

Sorting isn't a big deal when it comes to smaller data.

BUT

When inputs get larger and larger, it gets more complex. Think Google or Amazon, sorting news articles sorted by time or products sorted by rating.

Custom sorted methods become important. Sorted or pre-processed data is important.

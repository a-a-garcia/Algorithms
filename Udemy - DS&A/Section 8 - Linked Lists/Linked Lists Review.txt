LINKED LISTS

*Fast Insertion
*Fast Deletion
*Ordered
*Flexible Size
--Excessive overhead memory cost in arrays if dataset is growing,as array and entire contents have to be copied over and over, doubling up the space

:(
*Slow Lookups - have to traverse through the list if looking for something
*More Memory

When to use one over the other?

Singly -

Pros
*Simple implementation
*Less memory
    -it's a bit faster because of this with inserts, deletes

Cons
*Cannot be traversed in reverse
    -meaning. if you ever lose reference to this.head node, the data may be lost

In conclusion...

Appropriate to use when you have less memory resource.
And you main goal is fast insetion + deletion. You don't have much searching to do.

Doubly -

Pros
*Can be traversed from the front or back.
*If you need to delete a previous node, you don't need to traverse from the head node.

Cons
*Fairly complex
*more memory and storage cost.
* additional operations when inserting and deleting to update prev node

In conclusion...

Appropriate when you don't have limitation on memory resource
When you want good operation for searching for elements - searching forwards and backwards.

IN INTERVIEWS TYPICALLY GOING TO SEE SINGLY LINKED LISTS
may be asked theoretical or broad question about how singly and doubly are different.

A trie is a specialized tree used in searching, most often with text.

In most cases, it outperforms most other data structures.

It allows you to know if a word or part of a word exists in a body of text.

Usually has an empty root node.

From there, letters are added. It's not a binary tree it can have multiple children.

Another word for a trie is a prefix tree. You can think of it as autocompletion.


time complexity
O(length of the word)

BSTs

:)
-Better than O(n) 
-Ordered
-Flexible Size

:(
-No O(1) Operations

Who wins vs Arrays ?
    - Lookup ? BSTs! O(logN). O(n) for Arr
    - Insert ? BSTs! Unless adding to end or beginning, otherwise must shift all indexes
    - Delete ? BSTs! Unless adding to end or beginning, otherwise must shift all indexes

Who wins vs Hash Maps ?
    - Lookup ? While Hashmaps have O(1), BSTs have sorted data (parent/child relationships)
    - Insert ? While Hashmaps have O(1), BSTs have sorted data (parent/child relationships)
    - Delete ? While Hashmaps have O(1), BSTs have sorted data (parent/child relationships)

In summary, BSTs aren't the fastest for anything, but they aren't the slowest either.

On average, arrays and objects will be faster, but there are certain conditions where they do outperform.

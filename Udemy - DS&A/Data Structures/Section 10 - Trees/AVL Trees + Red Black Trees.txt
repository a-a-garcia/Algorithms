Usually in production, you want a balanced search tree.

There are two stypes of search trees that you'd most likely use in production

-AVL Tree

-Red Black Tree 

These trees automatically rebalance themselves.

We don't need to code themselves, usually there are libraries that implement them.

So how does something like an AVL tree work?

It basically restructures the tree if a tree would become unbalanced when adding a node, by updating left and/or right references.

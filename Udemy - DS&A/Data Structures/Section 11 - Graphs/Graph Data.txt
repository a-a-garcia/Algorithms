Graphs are built on top of other data structures.
Node with children and different pointers!

3 ways you can think of building graphs..

#1 - Edge list
const graph = [[0,2], [2,3], [2,1], [1,3]];
-The nested arrays represent the connections. 0 is connected to 2, 2 is connected to 3.. and so on.

#2 - Adjacent list
const graph = [[2], [2,3], [0,1,3], [1,2]]
-The index represent the NODE
-The values represents the NODE'S NEIGHBORS
-could be represented as an object

#3 - Adjacent matrix
const graph = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
]
-The index represents the NODE
-Binary to represent whether a node has a connection to the node at that index (0 being no, 1 being yes)
-could be represented as an object

Directed vs Undirected Graphs

Describe traffic flow - in which movement is not bidirectional.

Directed graphs - Directions in which data flows is defined. Twitter. People can follow you. But you don't automatically follow them.

Undirected - no definition of direction. Think of a highway between two cities. You can go back and forth. Facebook. When you're connected to a friend, a friend is also connected to you.

___

Weighted vs Unweighted

Unweighted - has no information in the edges (connections)

Weighted - has information in the edges (connections). google maps, what's the fastest way to get to your destination

___

Cyclic vs Acyclic

Cyclic - When all vertices are connected (in a circular fashion), when you can go from one node to another to another and back to the original node... Many weighted graphs are also cyclic.

Acyclic - You can't do that.

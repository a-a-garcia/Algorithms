Arrays
 :)
* Fast look ups - WHEN you know what index to look up
* Fast push/pop - from beginning or end only
* Ordered - the items in an array are stored close to each other in memory

 :(
* Slow inserts/deletes, from anywhere except the begining or end, because we must shift all the elements
* If using static arrays, they are fixed size, and their storage must be pre-defined. (most languages have dynamic arrays, however)

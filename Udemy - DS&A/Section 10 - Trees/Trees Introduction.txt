Trees are a data structure that are hierarchal, unlike linked lists that are linear.

Trees can have 0 or more child nodes.

Trees usually start with a single root node or parent node.

Every child only has one parent.

Biggest most simplest example is the DOM.

We use the same principle as we do as linked lists. We have nodes with relationships.

Linked lists are technically a type of tree - only there's just one single path.

A node can only point to a child. Nodes don't really have to reference their parent.

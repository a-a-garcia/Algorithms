* Start looking at interviews as a skill! Each one you do will make you better.

* Shift your perspective. A job description is a guideline of what type of work you will be doing, not what type of work have you done in the past.

    * DS + A.
    * Have you built projects and can you built something on your own?
    * Do you have 1-2 projects using the related technologies?

* Hiring devs is about more than technical skills. - Non technical skills.

* "If you never ask, the answer is always no."

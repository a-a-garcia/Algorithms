You can think of "Stacks" as plates.

We have one piece of data, then another piece of data that "stacks" on top, and so on...

You can only touch the top plate! If you want the bottom plate, you have to grab all the plates from the top, down.

LIFO - Last In, First Out.

Why/When is this useful?

1) When you need to know the very last value added

2) important in language specific engines. Stack overflow

3) JavaScript depends on stacks!
Modeled with stack architecture in mind

4) Browser history. When you go back and forth between sites, back button forward button - uses stacks

5) undo and redo buttons - stacks

LOOKUP O(n) - you usually don't want to traverse through a whole stack - expensive operation
POP O(1)
PUSH O(1)
PEEK O(1) - view the topmost plate

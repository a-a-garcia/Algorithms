Think of Queues as a line. (to a rollercoaster, restaurant, etc)

The first person in line gets to go first, then the next, and so on.

opposite of stacks in that...

FIFO - First In, First Out

Why are they useful?

1) Waitlist app... for buying concert tix

2) Restaurant app - for your place in line

3) Uber, Lyft, rider priority

4) Printer - whoever clicks print first gets their printout first.

LOOKUP - O(n) - usually don't do
ENQUEUE/Push O(1) - add to que
DEQUEUE/Pop O(1) - unlike pop though, this takes out the FIRST person in line, not the last.
PEEK O(1) - Whats the first item thats going to come out?

You can use an array over a queue, but it's not advised because the unshift/shift costs of an array are O(n) due to shifting all corresponding indexes vs the enqueue/dequeue costs of O(1)

Stacks and Queues are very similar. They can be implemented in similar ways.

The main difference is how items get removed.

They are linear data structures - "high level".

Meaning they allow you to traverse data elements sequentially.

In Stacks and Queues, you mainly use them to run commands like push, peak, pop. Dealing with data at the end or the beginning.

Why even use them???????????????

They are used because you may not need all of the functionality of an array, a linked list, etc. Sometimes you only want limited functionality - designing the right tool for the job so to speak!
